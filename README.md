# flexpath-async-programming-with-js-exercises

## Exercise overview

The intention of this exercise is to give you more experience
managing asynchronous operations in the browser using JavaScript.

## Getting Started


1. Using Visual Studio Code, open the folder `flexpath-async-programming-with-js-exercises` 
   wherever you saved it on your device. 
2. Then open the `flexpath-async-programming-with-js-exercises/exercise` folder. 
   Inside is a file named `index.html`. Open this file in your web browser
   using the methods shown in `flexpath-html-and-css-in-depth-exercises`.
3. You will write your JavaScript code in `exercise.js`. Any time you make a 
   change, save the file and then refresh the webpage displaying your .html web
   page in the browser.

   We have included a video `js-async-web.mp4` showing how to do this.

   Exercise instructions are provided to you as code comments in the `exercise.js`
   file.
   

Exercise solutions are in the `/solution` folder

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
    
    - Understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous code execution.
    - Working with callbacks and the challenges they present, such as the callback pyramid of doom.
2. **Promises**:
    
    - Creating and using Promises in JavaScript.
    - Promise states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
    - Consuming promises using `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods.
    - Chaining multiple promises for sequential execution.
    - Handling errors and understanding how promises handle rejected states.
    - Using Promise-based libraries like Axios.
3. **Async/Await**:
    
    - Simplifying asynchronous code using the `async` and `await` keywords.
    - Error handling in async functions using try-catch blocks.
    - Using async/await for sequential and parallel API requests.
    - Combining promises and async/await for more complex asynchronous flows.
4. **Advanced Promise Methods**:
    
    - `Promise.all`: Running multiple promises concurrently and waiting for all to complete.
    - `Promise.allSettled`: Handling all promises and capturing both resolved and rejected outcomes.
    - `Promise.any`: Returning the first resolved promise and handling multiple sources of data.
    - `Promise.race`: Handling the first settled promise, whether fulfilled or rejected.
5. **HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Making HTTP requests using `XMLHttpRequest` and Fetch API.
    - Handling and configuring HTTP headers and status codes.
    - Using AbortController to cancel requests.
    - Understanding CORS and preflight requests.
